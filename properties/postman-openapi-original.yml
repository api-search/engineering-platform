  title: Postman API
  description: |
    The Postman API enables you to programmatically access data stored in your Postman account.

    > Certain endpoints may be unavailable depending on your region and/or Postman plan.

    For a comprehensive set of examples of requests and responses, see the [**Postman API** collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/documentation/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a).

    ## Getting started

    You can get started with the Postman API by creating a copy of this definition in your workspace.

    ### EU users

    For users in the EU with [**Enterprise** plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), the Postman API uses the `http://api.eu.postman.com` subdomain. This is available in the definition's list of servers. You can change this by selecting the `http://api.eu.postman.com` subdomain in the **Server** dropdown list below.

    ## About the Postman API

    - You must use a valid API Key to send requests to the API endpoints.
    - The API has [rate and usage limits](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-api-rate-limits/).
    - The API only responds to HTTPS-secured communications. Any requests sent via HTTP return an HTTP `301` redirect to the corresponding HTTPS resources.
    - The API returns requests responses in JSON format. When an API request returns an error, it is sent in the JSON response as an error key.
    - The request method (verb) determines the nature of action you intend to perform. A request made using the `GET` method implies that you want to fetch something from Postman. The `POST` method implies you want to save something new to Postman.
    - For all requests, API calls respond with their corresponding [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). In the Postman client, the status code also provides help text that details the possible meaning of the response code.
    - When calling the API Builder endpoints, you must send an `Accept` header with the `application/vnd.api.v10+json` value.

    ### IDs and UIDs

    All items in Postman, such as collections, workspaces, and APIs, have IDs and UIDs:

    - An ID is the unique ID assigned to a Postman item. For example, `ec29121c-5203-409f-9e84-e83ffc10f226`.
    - The UID is the **full** ID of a Postman item. This value is the item's unique ID concatenated with the user ID. For example, in the `12345678-ec29121c-5203-409f-9e84-e83ffc10f226` UID:
        - `12345678` is the user's ID.
        - `ec29121c-5203-409f-9e84-e83ffc10f226` is the item's ID.

    ### Enum values

    Any documented enum values should be considered partial lists and may change over time.

    ### 403 response for unavailable features

    Depending on your region and/or Postman [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), some endpoints will return an HTTP `403 Forbidden` response with the "This feature isn't available in your region." detail.

    ### 503 response

    An HTTP `503 Service Unavailable` response from our servers indicates there is an unexpected spike in API access traffic. The server is usually operational within the next five minutes.

    If the outage persists or you receive any other form of an HTTP `5XX` error, [contact support](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/requests/new/).

    ## Authentication

    Postman uses API keys for authentication. The API key tells the API server that the request came from you. Everything that you have access to in Postman is accessible with your API key. You can [generate](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key) a Postman API key in the [**API keys**](https://postman.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys) section of your Postman account settings.

    You must include an API key in each request to the Postman API with the `X-API-Key` request header. In Postman, you can store your API key as a [vault secret](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) or an [environment variable](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments). The Postman API [collection](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections) will use it to make API calls.

    ### SCIM authentication

    While all other endpoints in this collection require a Postman API key, the SCIM endpoints require a [SCIM API key](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/#generating-scim-api-key).

    ### Authentication error response

    If an API key is missing, malformed, or invalid, you will receive an HTTP `401 Unauthorized` response code.

    ## Rate and usage limits

    API access [rate limits](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-api-rate-limits/) apply at a per-user basis in unit time. The limit is **300 requests per minute**. Postman Monitors, the GET `/collections`, and the GET `/workspaces` endpoint have a rate limit of **10 calls in 10 seconds**. Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you may also have [usage limits](https://learning.postman.com/docs/billing/resource-usage/).

    When you reach your rate or usage limits, the API returns the following HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` status code with one of the following error responses:

    - `rateLimited` — Rate limits reached. The response returns the time after which you can resume calls to the Postman API.
    - `serviceLimitExhausted` — Postman API service limits reached. You will need to contact your Postman Team Admin for assistance.

      - To use SCIM, you must have only **one** SSO method configured. If you have more than one SSO method enabled, you cannot generate an SCIM API key.
      - You can only deactivate users with the SCIM API. You cannot permanently delete users with the API.
      - You must [configure SSO](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/) and [enable SCIM](http://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/managing-your-team/configuring-scim/#enabling-scim-provisioning) for your Postman team to use these endpoints.

      ### Rate limits

      For your organization's team, Postman applies per-minute rate limits across all SCIM API endpoints. This helps ensure that you have the best experience using Postman's SCIM API. The rate limits apply as follows:
      - **Write (POST, PUT, PATCH)** — 180 requests per minute.
      - **Read (GET)** — 300 requests per minute.

      If you reach the rate limit, the API will return an HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` response.

        - Git-connected APIs will only return the `versions` and `gitInfo` query responses. This is because schema and collection information is stored in the connected Git repository. The `gitInfo` object only lists the repository and folder locations of the files.
        - API viewers can only use the `versions` option in the `include` query parameter.

        - `COPY_COLLECTION` — Copies a collection from the workspace and adds it to an API.
        - `CREATE_NEW` — Creates a new collection by providing the new collection's content.
        - `GENERATE_FROM_SCHEMA` — Generates the collection from an API schema.
            - `options` — An object that contains advanced creation options and their values. You can find a complete list of properties and their values in Postman's [OpenAPI to Postman Collection Converter OPTIONS documentation](https://github.com/postmanlabs/openapi-to-postman/blob/develop/OPTIONS.md). These properties are case-sensitive.

        **Note:**

        - You must pass a collection ID (`12ece9e1-2abf-4edc-8e34-de66e74114d2`), not a collection UID (`12345678-12ece9e1-2abf-4edc-8e34-de66e74114d2`), in this endpoint.
        - This endpoint acts like a PATCH method. It only updates the values that you pass in the request body (for example, the `name` property). The endpoint does not update the entire resource.

        Creates a server response. Server responses let you simulate 5xx server-level responses, such as 500 or 503.

        Server-level responses are agnostic to application-level logic. Server responses let you simulate this behavior on a mock server. You do not need to define each error for all exposed paths on the mock server.

        If you set a server response as active, then all the calls to the mock server return with that active server response.

        **Note:**

        You can create multiple server responses for a mock server, but only one mock server can be set as active.

If an existing Postman account uses an email that matches a group member's email ID, an [email invite](https://postman.postman.co/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#invites) to join your Postman team is sent to that user. Once the user accepts the invite, they'll be added to your team.

        By default, the system assigns new users the developer role. You can [update user roles in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-team-roles).

      description: |
        Creates a new user account in Postman and adds the user to your organization's Postman team.
        - If the account does not exist, this also activates the user so they can authenticate in to your Postman team.
        - If an account matching the email ID exists, the user receives [email invite](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-members/#manage-invites) to join the Postman team. The user joins the team when they accept the invite.
        - If the user's email domain matches your team's verified domains, the user is immediately added to the team.

        By default, the system assigns new users the developer role. You can [update user roles in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-members/#manage-team-roles).

        **Note:**

        Users must join the team before you can assign them to any groups.

        **Note:**

        This endpoint returns a 403 `Forbidden` response if the user does not have permission to create workspaces. [Admins and Super Admins](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can configure workspace permissions to restrict users and/or user groups from creating workspaces or require approvals for the creation of team workspaces.

        ### Important

        We deprecated linking collections or environments between workspaces. We do not recommend that you do this.

        If you have a linked collection or environment, note the following:
        - The endpoint does not create a clone of a collection or environment.
        - Any changes you make to a linked collection or environment changes them in all workspaces.
        - If you delete a collection or environment linked between workspaces, the system deletes it in all the workspaces.

                  **Note:**

                  Git-connected APIs will only return the `versions` and `gitInfo` query responses. This is because schema and collection information is stored in the connected Git repository. The `gitInfo` object only lists the repository and folder locations of the files.
